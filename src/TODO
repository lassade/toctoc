TODO

- Pretty json (inline hint?)

- Performance of ser/de
  how to improve
  no inlining makes the stack grow bigger? probably and also make the code a bit slow
  how much does it save in space compared with nanoserde/serde/miniserde?

- Comment the derive code as much as possible

- Deep stack support deep-recursion
  - Tests for both bson and json
